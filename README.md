# ThesisProject
The Objective is to design a mechanism to enable the coexistence of heterogeneous networks: IEEE 802.11b Wireless LANs and IEEE 802.15.4 Low-Rate Wireless Personal Area Network in the ISM band. The project involved study of existing solutions and propose a design for heterogeneous networks coexistence.

The proposed solution employs an external Channel Allocator(CA) to make the wireless medium available to ZigBee network for communication. The channel allocator consists of a spectrum analyzer, scheduler and a transceiver. The RSS threshold value of the spectrum analyzer is set to the transmit power level of the ZigBee nodes i.e the CA captures all the transmitted signals whose signal strength is greater than the ZigBee nodeâ€™s transmitted signal strength, thus the channel allocator will have the complete idea of the channel occupancy and the networks contending for the channel. The channel allocator determines the average time between the beacons of each WiFi access point and it also determines the different ZigBee networks present. The CA runs a dynamic TDMA scheme to make the channel available to Zigbee networks for communication.
